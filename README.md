## About the dataset:
- sheet 1 contains data - client id, volume sold, sale date
- sheet 2 contains data - client id, Geoid
## Analysis Findings:
Q2 yoy growth slowed from 4% as of Q1 to 2.7% primarily because of following reasons:
- In the region LATAM two clients with high volume share left, driving overall growth for this region down from 9% in Q1 to 0% in Q2 yoy.
- One client with high volume has onboarded the NAM region in Q2 2020 and stayed till last. This caused gowth % number of Q1 2020 to be a bulged number making growth% of Q2 yoy look smaller for NAM region.
